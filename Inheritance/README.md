Sometimes, we create classes to get information from with respect to the hierarchy in regards to which classes inherit from which class.
For example, ToString inherits from Object.In Base Level, we have what's called Object. Say we are making an Education app. 
We have teachers and Students. Or say we have a car selling platform and we have Trucks and Man. Every man vehicle is a Truck. 
Same as with teachers and Students they are both humans.We create relations between the two classes and create what's called a base class.
We create field/properties for the base class so that the derived classes can inherit functionality from the base class. The inheritance 
hierarchy goes likes this. User inherits from the Object Class. User has two fields FirstName and LastName.Students inherits from User and 
Teacher inherits from User.
