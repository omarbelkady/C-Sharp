## Static Methods
### When Something is Static it is attached to the Class rather than an instance of a class/Object.
### An instance method is attached to the instances of the class/objects of the class. 
### We define a class and then we create instances of the class
### which are known as objects. When you define a method in the class. Everytime you
### instantiate the class into an object the method is made available
